1. What is a namespace? Explain its purpose.
Namespace is a declaration  to avoid confusions between the similar named variables,functions, modules etc.
It is very useful in bigger projects as there are various identifiers with similar looking names.

2. Why are header files needed? Explain.
Header files are needed to minimize the redundant work in each source file. 
You can declare a function in a header file and use it in multiple sourcecode files.

3. In the instructions above, you were directed to compile only .cpp files but
not the .h files. Explain why you should never compile header files.
because Header files are already included in the cpp files. #include 

4. Explain why you should never include .cpp files in another file.
Because compiler will compile .cpp file and if we will include .cpp file in another file , then compiler will compile same file multiple time.

5. Explain in your own words what have you learned on this workshop.
I learned in this workshop :
How to use namespace, and how to use compilation safe guards in header files.
