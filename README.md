Introduction to Object Oriented Programming

 Modern software applications are intricate, dynamic and complex. 
 The number of lines of code can exceed the hundreds of thousands or millions. 
 These applications evolve over time.  Some take years of programming effort to mature.  
 Creating such applications involves many developers with different levels of expertise. 
 Their work consists of smaller stand alone and testable sub-projects; sub-projects that are transferrable, practical, 
 upgradeable and possibly even usable within other future applications. 
 The principles of software engineering suggest that each component should be highly 
 cohesive and that the collection of components should be loosely coupled. 
 Object-oriented languages provide the tools for implementing these principles. 

C++ is an object-oriented programming language specifically designed to provide a simple, 
comprehensive feature set for programming modern applications without loss in performance. 
C++ combines the efficiencies of the C language with the object-oriented features necessary for the development of large applications.
