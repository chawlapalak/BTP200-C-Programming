1.	What is the difference between an abstract base class and a concrete class?
Ans -> Abstract Class is a base class, it may contain partially implemented methods, Some or all declared functions are purely virtual, and it cannot be instantiated.
	   
	   Concrete Class is a default class, All methods are completely implemented, No purely virtual functions, and it can be instantiated.

2.	Identify the functions that shadow functions of the same name in your solution?

ANS-> ChequingAccount::credit() shadows Account::credit() in the main() function,
	  ChequingAccount::debit() shadows Account::debit() in the main() function,
	  ChequingAccount::monthEnd() shadows SavingsAccount::monthEnd() in the main() function,
	  ChequingAccount::display() shadows SavingsAccount::display().

3.	Explain what have you learned in this workshop.
Ans-> derive classes from base classes 
	  usage of methods defined in an abstract class within the derived class
	  shadowing 
	  pure virtual functions

	  Q3:Adhoc polymorphism is also called function or operator overloading.Ad-hoc polymorphism refers to when a value is able to adopt any one of several types.
