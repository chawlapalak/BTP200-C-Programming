1) Why do you need to allocate new dynamic memory when you increase the
size of an existing array of dynamically allocated memory?
As in case of increasing the size of the existing array, we have to copy the elements to the new allocated dynamic memory.
So that we can use the new memory location to store more data, after copying from the previous memory before deleting it.

2) The Kingdom structure stores the name of the kingdom in an array of characters.
At the end of the program, we do not use the delete operator to deallocate
the memory occupied by the name. Why don’t we need to use the
delete operator on this array itself? Explain.
At the end of the program, we didnot use the delete operator to deallocate the memory because it will go out of scope auomatically when the function will end.

3) There are two display(...) function definitions. How does the compiler
know which definition to call from your main function?
Compiler will always call non constant function first ,if present in the main function as a rule.
 And in case, no constant function is not there, then const function is called.

4) Explain what have you have learned in this workshop.
How to allocate and deallocate dynamic memory, and overloading a function and resizing of the dynamic memory allocated.
